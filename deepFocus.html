    The Concept of Deep Focus is very important for me, As I am Very easily distracted.
    The Name comes from a Spotify Playlist, which I Often Use to Work when I am in a loud surroundings.
</p>
<p>
    Here are some useful Tools I use:
</p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="https://www.deepl.com/translator">Deepl</a> is like google Translate but much better</li>
    <li><a href="https://apps.ankiweb.net/">Anki</a> is a Flashcard App, which I use alot due to my hit & miss memory.
        Its available as a Webapp, or an App for Computer & Phone and you can even share & find Flashcard decks on
        <a href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/decks/">this website</a></li>

</ul>
